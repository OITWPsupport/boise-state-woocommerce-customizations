# Boise State WooCommerce Customizations
Applies fixes and customizations to Boise State sites using Woocommerce with the Storefront theme:
1. Hides some product information that's not useful in our implementations. 
1. Hides the form used to sort the catalog display. 
1. Adds title attributes to some button elements to prevent wcag errors. 
1. Includes a stylesheet from Google so we can use the Montserrat font.
1. Allows site admin to change the placeholder text in the search field (which defaults to 'Search products...').
1. Allows site admin to change the text of the first breadcrumb item (which defaults to 'Home').

Replaces the [boise-state-woocommerce-breadcrumb-fix](https://github.com/OITWPsupport/boise-state-woocommerce-breadcrumb-fix) plugin. That plugin's functionality is duplicated here, so we're deprecating that one.
